Absolutely! Here's a simple and delicious recipe for a classic chocolate cake. I've included both the wet and dry ingredients, as well as instructions for baking and decorating the cake.

**Ingredients:**

*For the cake:*
1. 2 cups (400 g) all-purpose flour
2. 2 cups (400 g) granulated sugar
3. 3/4 cup (75 g) unsweetened cocoa powder
4. 2 teaspoons baking powder
5. 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
6. 1 teaspoon salt
7. 1 cup (2 sticks or 227 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
8. 1/2 cup (120 ml) vegetable oil
9. 2 large eggs
10. 1 large egg yolk
11. 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
12. 1 1/2 cups (375 ml) whole milk
13. 2 teaspoons white vinegar or lemon juice
14. 1 cup (236 ml) boiling water

*For the frosting:*
15. 1/2 cup (1 stick or 113 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
16. 2 cups (450 g) powdered sugar
17. 3/4 cup (180 ml) unsweetened cocoa powder
18. 1/3 cup (79 ml) milk
19. 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease two 9-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Dust with cocoa powder, shaking out excess. Set aside.

*For the cake:*
2. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
3. In a separate large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, beat butter and oil together until creamy and smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, followed by the yolk, beating well after each addition.
4. Beat in vanilla extract. With the mixer on low speed, gradually add flour mixture, alternating with milk in three parts, starting and ending with the flour mixture.
5. In a small bowl or measuring cup, combine vinegar or lemon juice with boiling water. Gradually add this to the batter and mix just until blended.
6. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans on wire racks for 10 minutes, then remove from pans and transfer to wire racks to cool completely.

*For the frosting:*
7. In a large bowl, beat butter until creamy and smooth. Gradually add powdered sugar and cocoa powder, beating well after each addition.
8. Add milk and vanilla extract, then continue beating until light and fluffy.

To assemble and decorate the cake:
Place one cake layer on a serving plate or pedestal. Spread about 1/3 of the frosting over the top, spreading evenly to the edges. Place the second cake layer on top and spread another 1/3 of the frosting over the top and around the sides of the cake. Use the remaining frosting to decorate the top and sides of the cake as desired. Enjoy!
