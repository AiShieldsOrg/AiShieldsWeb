Sure! Here's a classic recipe for a delicious chocolate cake:

### Ingredients:
- 1 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 cups granulated sugar
- 1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup milk
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup boiling water

### For the chocolate frosting:
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 3 cups powdered sugar
- 1/3 cup milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat** your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.

2. **In a large bowl**, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

3. **Add eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla** to the dry ingredients and beat on medium speed for about 2 minutes. 

4. **Stir in boiling water**. The batter will be thin, but that's okay!

5. **Pour** the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans.

6. **Bake** in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

7. **Remove** from the oven and let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

8. **For the frosting**: In a medium bowl, beat the butter until creamy. Add cocoa powder and powdered sugar alternately with the milk, beating to spreading consistency. Add more milk if needed. Stir in vanilla.

9. **Once the cakes are completely cooled**, frost the top of one cake layer with the chocolate frosting. Place the second layer on top and frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting.

10. **Optional**: You can decorate your cake with chocolate shavings, sprinkles, or any other toppings you like.

11. **Slice** and enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate cake!

Feel free to adjust the sweetness or richness of the cake and frosting according to your taste preferences. Enjoy baking!
